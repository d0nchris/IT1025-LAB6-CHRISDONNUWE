## Internet Architecture
### intertet protocol
IP Addresss This is the Internet Protocol Addres that uses numbers assigned to it to refer to computre nrtworwork interfaces
##### Differences between IPv4 and IPv6
Ipv4 addresses are written as a string of four numbers between 0 and 225 seperated by dots. forexample 192.0.2.53
##### while 
ipv6 addresses are longer strings of numbers written using hexadecimal whicn fix information into frw digits. Colons are used in ipv6 instead of dots for example 2001:0db8:53
##### What is ICANN
ICANN is the Inernet COrporation For Assigned Names And NUmbers and its contribution to the global internet is to review and develop recommendations on Inernet protocol policy to ensure stable and secure interoperable internet.

### TCP/IP
The Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet protocol is responsible to define the details on hoe data is sent and received through different network adapters,hubs,switches,routers and other communication hardware.
#### Client-server applies to TCP/IP
The client server model applies to TCP/Ip the same way a phone operates.For example The client is the TCP/IP connection is the computer/device that dials the phone and the server is the computer that is listening on the incoming calls.Hence the clients needs to know the ip address of the servers it wants to connect to and also it needs to know the port numbers it will be send and receiving data through after a connection has been establised. The server only has to listen to the connection to either accept ofr reject them when intiated by the client.Once the connection is establised by the TCP/Ipclient and TCP/IP server data can be exchanged to either direction.

##### Importance of layers 
Layers help in changing technologies to be able to communicate amongst different networks without affecting the other layers
##### Aplication
application types like HTTP,FTP,POPS,SMTP,SNMP run on the application layer.

### Internet Security
#### HTTP and the client sever model
HTTP is Hypertext transfer protocol that is used by surfers to view webpages on the internet.
How the client server model works with http is a user types a webpage on the device in a text format then the http encryots the text to be transfered across the internet to the server.
 #### Protocols that secure HTTP
 ##### HTTPS hypertext transfer secure
 This is the protocol that is used to change user text into encrypted data that can be safely transfered across the internet
 ##### SSl Secure Socket layer
 This is the protocol that is used to ensure security on the internet.It uses public key encryption to secure data.
 ##### TLS Transport Layer Security
 This is the lastest standard cryptographic protocol. IT autheticates the server,client and encrypts the data.
 
 ### Security Web Browser.
 This is very important to protect internet users from vulnebilities such as;
 ##### Crosssite scripting
 This is a vulnearability whereby a website is used to permit an hacker to leverage the trust and relationship the user has with the site they  are visiting.
 ##### Crosszone/Cross domain
 This is where the hackers violates the domain names of websites
 ##### Detection Evasion
 This is the use of software anti-virus systems /intrusion detetion system IDC to help with protecting the devices from virus but they need acces to certain pattern which may expose user data if hacked.
 ### Risks in vulnearability
 ActiveX is a technology used by Microsoft internet exploree on the windows syatem. It allows applications to access and utilise data on the web broweser thus webpage can use ActiveX components on windows systems. this may cause more server vilnerabilities to the user if the components are not properly implemented .
 
 ### HTML and CSS
#### HTML Hypertext Markup langauge
is used to create documents/pagesw that can be displayed on the internet browsers by describing the structure and presentation of the data on the inernet.
#### CSS Cascading style sheets 
This is used to help developers to seperate content from layout and design of a websites. It describes the presentation of a wepage from clors, layout,fonts which helps are websites to display on different devices.

### HTML  and XML
 XML was designed to carry data with the focus on what data is. 
 #### while
 HTML was designed to display data with the focus on how the data looks.
 
 
## Components of URL
##### Scheme------http
##### top level domain-----.edu
##### Anchor------Specific location on a page
##### parameters----results of search
##### default page --------no file path provided
##### domain-------- www.amazom.com 
All components of the URL work together to help the users access the websites in that;from a scheme(http),domain name,file path,parameter and anchor a web users is able to search ansd access the url data on the internet.
